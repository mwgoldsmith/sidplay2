Known Problems:

If you are having unresolved symbol problems when linking against the
libsidplay2 libraries then you need to update Libtool.  Libtool versions
1.3b and greater are the only ones that use the installed .la files.  These
files contain all the library dependencies required by libsidplay2.  Also
make sure you apply the necessary patch to automake that is described in the
Libtool README file.
