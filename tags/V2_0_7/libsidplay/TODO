TODO <libsidplay2>:

*Hardsid support <In Progress, non realtime drivers available, realtime drivers
 in progress.  Windows drivers will begin after this release>

*Fix encoding to properly use PCM_UNSIGNED or PCM_SIGNED.  See mixer.cpp
 and audiodrv.cpp

*Convert MOS6510 Cycle_Data and Register_Accumulator registers to ubyte_sidt.
 Upon changing these the code will need a serious debugging setion.

*New Bank Switching implementation for remappable componenets <Delayed>

*Optimise reSID? <Clock, output, read, write>

*Fastforward, Rewind.  <Under test, please comment on it's performance, there
 are both Windows and Linux versions available>

*Length detection <Delayed>

*What functions are required on the interface for other applications <Suggestions please>

*Support for credit access, both from sid and imported components <Next release>.

*MOS6510:  Remove opcodes to individual files to support optimised versions.
           I have these in asm already, but was written in BorlandC.  <Needs converting>
           This way a C functon will be used if an asm is not present.

*xSID Should inherit the sid <Next release>

*Provide and base class for the sid to easier support resid/hardsid <Next release>.

*Possibly provide a wds sync output for stereoplayer.  These helps external players
which support this to sync properly to the music, there are some that use
non-real time.  Needs stereosidplayer v10.3 being ripped
<Do not implement full wds support in libsidplay, SYNC ONLY>.  If anyone knows
anything about the C64s stereosidplayers internals could they contact
sidplay2@email.com

*Add 24 bit support.

*Quad sids

*Provide a C interface to the library <Maybe next release, probably required for a
 proposed Java front end>.

*VIC. Possibility for more support.
