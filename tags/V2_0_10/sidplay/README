This version id sidplay2 is source compatible with the libsidplay 2.1.1
and the new upcomming libsidplay 2.1.2.  Note these are not binary
compatible and as stated previously the 2.1.x serious is for development
to stabilise by 2.2.0.

Further changes to COM'ify the main interfaces are in the works.

Finally the use of the -q switch is depreciated.  Use -v with a
negative number instead (-q1 is equivalent to -v-1).
