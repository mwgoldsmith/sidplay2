The result is a program which can load and execute C64 machine code programs which produce music and sound.  This page covers both sidplay versions 1 and 2, "sidplay" being an frame based emulation capable of playback on low  specification PCs.  "sidplay2" on the other hand has been designed for accuracy which results in a much higher cpu usuage.  Additional playback modes have however been provided to allow playback on low specification machines at the cost of accuracy, but it still has a higher cpu demand than "sidplay"..SH COMMON OPTIONS.TP\fB\--help|-h\fRDisplay help..TP\fB\-f<num>\fRSet frequency in Hz. (default: 22050).TP\fB\-nf\fRNo filter emulation.  Will reduce CPU overhead at the cost of reduced sound quality..TP\fB\-ns\fREmulate MOS8580 waveforms. (default: MOS6581).TP\fB\-o<num>\fRSelect track number. (default: preset).TP\fB\-s\fRStereo Hardware support.  However even when enabled the left and right channels will be playing the same music unless the song is identified as being stereo.  For sidplay other options are provided to produce special effects when in stereo mode, but sidplay2 does not as yet support these..TP\fB\-v\fRVerbose output while playing..SH SIDPLAY2 OPTIONS.TP\fB\-fd\fRForce dual sid environment.This forces emulation of  2 sid-chips for stereo playbackeven if datafile is identified as only being mono.  This occursin the case of the stereo sid format as currently there is no wayto identfy them.  Stereo MUS files are however automaticallydetected.  The second sid appears in the 0xD500 address range..TP\fB\-ne\fRNo external filter emulation.  Will reduce CPU overhead at the cost of reduced sound quality..TP\fB\-nf<name>\fRNew SID filter description filename using an ini file format..TP\fB\-p<num>\fRSet bit precision for samples. The default is 16, but this value will be affected by the hardware available on the platform you are running...TP\fB\-sl\fRLeft channel only.Playback left channel only from stereo datafile..TP\fB\-sr\fRRight channel only.Playback right channel only from stereo datafile..TP\fB\-O<num>\fROptimisation level. (default: 0).brOptimisation 0 - C64 emulation is kept fully cycle synced at all times and requires atleast a P300 for mono sid tunes.  Stereo sid tunes are expected to require a greater CPU..brOptimisation 1 - Allows the CPU to run by itself and only regains sync with the Sound Interface Device (SID) when a sample is required.  This reduces sound accuracy, but does allow playback of mono sids on a P166.  Again stereo sids require faster CPUs..TP\fB\-t<num>\fRSet play length in [mins]:secs format. (0 is endless).TP\fB\-vn\fRSet VIC NTSC clock speed (America, 60Hz)..TP\fB\-vp\fRSet VIC PAL clock speed (Europe, 50Hz)..TP\fB\-w\fRCreate WAV-file.  Output filename is <datafile>.wav and currently cannot be changed.SH SIDPLAY OPTIONS.TP\fB\-a\fRstrict PlaySID song compatibility (read the docs!)..TP\fB\-a2\fRbank switching mode (overrides -a)..TP\fB\-16\fRenable 16-bit sample mixing..TP\fB\-ss\fRenable stereo surround..TP\fB\-pc\fRenable centered auto-panning (stereo only)..TP\fB\-n\fRset NTSC clock speed (default: PAL)..TP\fB\-c\fRforce song speed = clock speed (PAL/NTSC)..TP\fB\-bn<num>\fRset number of audio buffer fragments to use..TP\fB\-bs<num>\fRset size 2^<num> of audio buffer fragments..TP\fB\-b<num>\fRset sample buffer size..RS.SH NOTESPlace for notes...SH OTHER INFORMATIONSidplay2 Homepage:    http://sidplay2.sourceforge.net/.brSidplay homepage:    http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/.brHigh Voltage Sid Collection (HVSC):    http://hvsc.c64.org/.SH AUTHORSsidplay2     - Simon White <sidplay2@email.com>.brsidplay      - Michael Schwendt <sidplay@geocities.com>.brreSID engine - Dag Lem <resid@nimrod.no>.brman-page     - Mikko Kilponen <mikil@uni.kaapeli.net>
