TODO <libsidplay2>:

*Remove bit fields in status register flags.  This could lead to compatibilty problems
on other platforms

*Fix _encoding to properly use PCM_UNSIGNED or PCM_SIGNED.  See sidmixer.cpp
 and audiodrv.cpp

*Voice muting (See end of file)

*Convert MOS6510 Cycle_Data and Register_Accumulator registers to ubyte_sidt.
 Upon changing these, the code will need a serious debugging setion. <Anyone?>

*CIA, more timer modes (and Real timer tick?)

*VIC basic support and control for scanline/refresh interrupt

*New Kernel Testing <Kernel now written>

*New Bank Switching implementation for remappable componenets <Started>

*Implement Real C64 Mode <Need more info on NMIs, anyone got a real C64>

*Find Timing bug in sidplay2 <Either CIA is wrong or output calculation>

*Implement playsid and transp modes <done>

*Change types to _sidt <done>

*Support Stereo mus files on one cpu. <done>

*Can someone optimise reSID? <Clock, output, read, write, in this order>

*Change xSID to use reSIDs/hardsids 0x18 register directly <Patch only?>

*Fastforward, Rewind.  Suggestions made by me to Grant about this... <Grant may do this>

*Length detection <Mike or Grant?  Grants is more basic>

*What access do you need for other applocations <Suggestions please>

*Support for credit access, both from sid and imported components.

*MOS6510:  Remove opcodes to individual files to support optimised versions.
           I have these in asm already, but was written in BorlandC.  <Need converting>
           This way a C functon will be used if an asm is not present.

*Fix xSIDs setting of ram addr.  Change to inherit environment <Another patch?>

*Possibly provide a wds sync output for stereoplayer.  These helps external players
which support this to sync properly to the music, there are some that use
non-real time.  Needs stereosidplayer v10.3 being ripped
<Do not implement full wds support in libsidplay, SYNC ONLY>.  If anyone knows
anything about the C64s stereosidplayers internals could they get contact
sidplay2@email.com

*Add 16 bit support. (possibly 24bit)

*Quad sids <Probably not>

*Provide a C interface to the library.

* Anyone with a C64, could they confirm the operation of the sid Game Over
  by Martin Galway. (Specific the Galway Noise beat, section of interest
  starts at 40 secs in on the default song). Maybe someone could record
  it from a real C64 and send it to me as an mp3 or wav file?

* Need to find more songs which mix Galway Noise and Samples, anyone?

*MORE...?





TODO: <sidplay2>
*Change main.cpp to use buffers of size frag <done>

*Find out why the music goes beserk sometimes when syncs are used with SNDCTL_DSP_SYNC <Done>

*Find out why there is a pause after a seconds or so play and try to correct.
The system seems to start and become heavily loaded and then continue fine.
Something is happening, not sure what.  Can we make it do whatever it is
before playback of sound begins.

*Find out why when you step over the Linux sound write function the soundcard
 plays rubbish (bug)?

*Take audiodrvs from sidplay.
 Linux <Done>
 DirectX <Done>
 Windows MMSYSTEM
 SPARC
 SGI
 HPUX

*Add proper help/error messages for bad command line parameters. <done>

*Convert Wav to a driver <done>

*Anyone want to provide support for other music formats? <IFF?>

*MORE...?

// Information on muting
Hi!

The HardSID Stereo mode needs to mute channels too, so I can tell you
my solution if you're interested:

Keep the gate bit in 0.
VoiceBase + 4 = IncomingData AND $FE

No mate, don't touch the freq. value, because it'll ruin other voices in the
tune when it's using ring modulation or synchronization !!!

Keeping the gate bit in 0 should be enough, it works pretty well for the
HardSID Stereo mode.
