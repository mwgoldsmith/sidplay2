TODO <libsidplay2>:

* hardsid support <Started>

* Song length database support <Started>

*Fix _encoding to properly use PCM_UNSIGNED or PCM_SIGNED.  See sidmixer.cpp
 and audiodrv.cpp

*Convert MOS6510 Cycle_Data and Register_Accumulator registers to ubyte_sidt.
 Upon changing these, the code will need a serious debugging setion. <Anyone?>

*CIA, more timer modes (and Real timer tick?)

*VIC basic support and control for scanline/refresh interrupt

*New Kernel Testing <Kernel now written>

*New Bank Switching implementation for remappable componenets <Started>

*Implement Real C64 Mode

*Can someone optimise reSID? <Clock, output, read, write, in this order>

Fastforward, Rewind.  Suggestions made by me to Grant about this... <Under test>

*Length detection <Started, based on Mikes>

*What access do you need for other applications <Suggestions please>

*Support for credit access, both from sid and imported components.

*MOS6510:  Remove opcodes to individual files to support optimised versions.
           I have these in asm already, but was written in BorlandC.  <Need converting>
           This way a C functon will be used if an asm is not present.

*Fix xSIDs setting of ram addr.  Change to inherit environment <Done, but really xSID should inherit reSID>

*Possibly provide a wds sync output for stereoplayer.  These helps external players
which support this to sync properly to the music, there are some that use
non-real time.  Needs stereosidplayer v10.3 being ripped
<Do not implement full wds support in libsidplay, SYNC ONLY>.  If anyone knows
anything about the C64s stereosidplayers internals could they get contact
sidplay2@email.com

*Add 16 bit support. (possibly 24bit) <Done, not 24 yet>

*Quad sids

*Provide a C interface to the library.




TODO: <sidplay2>

*Add configuration file support.

*Add ANSI support <Done in experimnetal, requires configuration file for real
 release>

*Find out why there is a pause after a seconds or so play and try to correct.
 The system seems to start and become heavily loaded and then continue fine.
 Something is happening, not sure what.  Can we make it do whatever it is
 before playback of sound begins.

*Find out why when you step over the Linux sound write function the soundcard
 plays rubbish (bug)?

*Take audiodrvs from sidplay.
 Linux (OSS only) <Done>
 DirectX <Done>
 Windows MMSYSTEM <Done>
 SPARC <Done>
 SGI
 HPUX

*Anyone want to provide support for other music formats? <IFF?>
